## Origami Swan - Full documentation

**Materials:**  
- 1 square sheet of paper (e.g. 15 × 15 cm)

---

### Step 1 – Orientation

1. Place the paper in front of you with **one corner pointing towards you** (diamond orientation).
2. Identify the corners as *top*, *bottom*, *left*, and *right* based on this orientation.
3. Fold the paper **in half diagonally**, bringing the top corner to the bottom corner.
4. Crease firmly, then unfold. This creates the **center crease**, which will serve as your reference line.

### Step 2 – Forming the Kite Base

5. Fold the **top right edge** inward so it aligns exactly with the **center crease**. Crease firmly.
6. Fold the **bottom right edge** inward so it aligns exactly with the **center crease**. Crease firmly.
7. The model now forms a **kite shape**, with the narrow tip pointing to the right.

### Step 3 – Narrowing the Kite

8. **Rotate the model 180° clockwise** so the narrow tip now points to the left.
9. **Flip the model over** so that the folded edges are now on the bottom and the smooth side is facing up.
10. Fold the **top left edge** inward to align with the center crease. Crease firmly.
11. Fold the **bottom left edge** inward to align with the center crease. Crease firmly.
