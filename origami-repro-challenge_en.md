# Origami-Reproducibility-Challenge

> **“Reproducibility and Documentation Using the Example of Origami”**

# Learning Objectives 🎯

## 🧠 Subject-Specific Learning Objectives  

Participants are able to …

- explain the importance of documentation for the reproducibility of results.  
- analyze differences between undocumented, unstructured documented, and structured documented processes.  
- comparatively analyze reproduction processes and reflect on them in a structured way.  
- identify and name factors that facilitate or hinder the reproduction of a result.  
- analyze and discuss the Origami challenge as a didactic method.  

## 👥 Social Learning Objectives  

Participants are able to …

- collaborate cooperatively in small groups on a shared task.  
- negotiate solution strategies within a team and coordinate work steps.  
- jointly reflect on and discuss challenges and solution approaches.  

## Working phase

Time: 15 minutes (5 minutes grouping & task explanation, 10 minutes folding)

Participants are divided into three small groups.

The task is explained.

---

## Group A – “No Documentation”

The group receives several copies of an origami model (e.g., heart, frog, swan).

**Conditions**:

- No written instructions  
- No sketches  
- No additional materials allowed  
- The model may be observed, examined, and unfolded  

**Possible Challenges**:  

- Be the first group to reproduce the modell.
- Create as many identical copies of the model as possible within given time.

---

## Group B – Unstructured Documentation

The group receives an unstructured, purely written set of instructions for the model.

**Conditions**:

- No sketches  
- No finished folded model  
- Text without clear structure  

**Possible Challenges**:  

- Be the first group to reproduce the modell.
- Create as many identical copies of the model as possible within given time.

---

## Group C – Structured Documentation

The group receives a structured, step-by-step set of instructions including sketches.

**Conditions**:

- No finished folded model  
- Clearly structured text  
- Visualizations included  

**Possible Challenges**:  

- Be the first group to reproduce the modell.
- Create as many identical copies of the model as possible within given time.

---

## Evaluation

After the working time has ended:

- Was it possible to reproduce the model?  
- Who was first? or How many copies were produced in each group?  
- What do the copies look like? Are there incorrect reproductions?  
- Is there a clear “winning group”? 🏆  

---

## Reflection Phase

Plenary discussion  

Time: 5 minutes  

Guiding questions:

- Which group was able to reproduce the model the fastest? Why?  
- What difficulties occurred?  
- What strategies were developed?  
- What role did the type of documentation play?  
- Why do we often underestimate the importance of documentation?  
- What implicit assumptions do we make about others’ prior knowledge?  

→ “What does this mean for scientific work?”

In a scientific context, what corresponds to …

- the finished origami model?  
- the unstructured instructions?  
- the structured instructions with sketches?  

### Possible Analogies

| Origami Setting                        | Scientific Equivalent                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Finished model without instructions    | Publication without a methods section                     |
| Unstructured text instructions         | Unclear or incomplete methodological documentation        |
| Structured instructions with sketches  | Transparent, standardized, and traceable documentation    |

## Method Reflection

Plenary discussion  
Time: 5 minutes  

- Discussion of the method  

  - Was the exercise enjoyable?  
  - Was the challenge motivating?  
  - Why was the challenge motivating or not motivating?  
  - What playful elements does the exercise include?  
  - How could the task be modified?  

- Which subject-specific and social learning objectives could be addressed with this or a similar origami exercise?  

- What risks, obstacles, or difficulties does the method involve?

# Origami Model Dokumentations

## Origami Swan - Full documentation

**Materials:**  
- 1 square sheet of paper (any size, e.g. 15 × 15 cm)

---

Step 1 – Orientation
---

![Origami Swan 1](./img/swan_01.png)<!-- style="float:right; width:40%;" -->

1. Place the paper in front of you with **one corner pointing toward you** (diamond orientation).
2. Identify the corners as *top*, *bottom*, *left*, and *right* based on this orientation.
3. Fold the paper **in half diagonally**, bringing the top corner to the bottom corner.
4. Crease firmly, then unfold. This creates the **center crease**, which will serve as your reference line.

Step 2 – Forming the Kite Base
---

![Origami Swan 2](./img/swan_02.png)<!-- style="float:right; width:40%;" -->

5. Fold the **top right edge** inward so it aligns exactly with the **center crease**. Crease firmly.
6. Fold the **bottom right edge** inward so it aligns exactly with the **center crease**. Crease firmly.

7. The model now forms a **kite shape**, with the narrow tip pointing to the right.



Step 3 – Narrowing the Kite
---

8. **Rotate the model 180° clockwise** so the narrow tip now points to the left.
9. **Flip the model over** so that the folded edges are now on the bottom and the smooth side is facing up.
10. Fold the **top left edge** inward to align with the center crease. Crease firmly.
11. Fold the **bottom left edge** inward to align with the center crease. Crease firmly.

Step 4 – Forming the body
---
12. Take the **left long pointed tip** and fold it horizontally so that it aligns with the **right pointed tip**. Crease firmly.

![Origami Swan 5](./img/swan_05.png)

13. Fold the tip **back to the left approximately one-third of its total length**. Crease firmly at the base.

![Origami Swan 6](./img/swan_06.png)

14. Fold the entire model **in half along the center crease**, bringing the upper side under the lower side. Crease firmly.

---

Step 4 – Forming the Neck and Head
---

15. Identify the **small pointed tip** (this will become the head).
16. Pull up the tip. Press at the base of the tip to set new crease.

![Origami Swan 8](./img/swan_08.png)

17. Identify the **long part below the tip** (this will become the neck).
18. Pull up the long part below the small pointed tip. Press at the base of the long part to set new crease.

---

Step 5 – Final Adjustments
---

17. Gently **pull the model apart** so the it can stand upright.
18. Ensure all creases are firm and the model is symmetrical.

**Finished:**  
You now have an origami swan. 🦢

## Swan - Poor documentation

Take a square sheet of paper and fold it diagonally. Open it again so you have a line in the middle. Fold both sides toward the middle so it becomes a kite shape. Turn it around. Fold the sides again so it gets narrower. Fold the long tip over to the other tip. Then fold it back a bit (about a third or so). Fold everything in half. Now pull up the small tip for the head and press it into place. Than pull up the longer part below it to make the neck. Open at the bottom slightly so it stands.

Done. 🦢
