## Origami Swan - Poor documentation

Take a sheet of paper and fold it. Open it again so you have a line in the middle. Fold both sides toward the middle so it becomes a kite shape. Turn it around. Fold the sides again so it gets narrower. Fold the long tip over to the other tip. Then fold the tip back a bit. Fold everything in half along the middle line. Now pull up the small tip and press it into place. This is the head. Than pull up the longer part below to make the neck. Open at the bottom slightly so it stands.

Done. 🦢
